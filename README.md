CodeAnalyzer
============

This is an Open Source GitHub project I started as a tool to help me analyze and refine ActionScript code for my current project, Speakaboos. It's an Adobe Air project that compiles to different platforms - AIR Desktop, IOS, Android and as a Web App. It uses Flash Builder and Eclipse, and a couple of plugins - eGit and Grep Console.

Here are some videos I put together to help get you set up to compile and run my project on three different platforms - Desktop, Mobile and Web.
